# Quantum_Computing_Tests

## Introduction

This is my attempt at learning quantum computing using the qiskit Python library. 
Part of this repository will be the code I write following along with the "Coding with Qiskit" video tutorial series which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClBNq7mCMf5xm8baE_VMl3A).
